1. Initial release
Game is initialized with the following information:
- contract color
- each player's cards
For each trick, game asks players in clockwise order for a card from his suit.  
If a player plays an illegal card, game does not accept it and asks again. First trick starts with E, 
every other trick starts with the player who took the previous trick. Game keeps track of who took what tricks. 
Game ends when players have no more cards. 

2. Add human player to initialization. Human can be E, N/S (N is dummy), or W. Display a basic game state, and 
prompt human for his move(s).

3. Each computer player plays a card that lets him or his partner take the trick. Computer players see everyone's cards.

4. Minimax, alpha-beta pruning, per-move time limit.

5. Implement computer players that can't see other players' unplayed cards.
